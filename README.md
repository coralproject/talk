## Description

Online comments are broken. Our open-source commenting platform,
[Coral](https://coralproject.net), rethinks how moderation, comment display, and
conversation function, creating the opportunity for safer, smarter discussions
around your work.


## Documentation

If you're new to Coral, the [Coral documentation](https://docs.coralproject.net/)
is a great place to start running and developing with Coral.

You’ve installed Coral, and you’re preparing to launch it on your site. The real
community work starts now, before you go live. You have a unique opportunity
pre-launch to set your community up for success. Read our
[Community Guides](https://guides.coralproject.net/start-here/) to learn more.

## Support

We can help you set up Coral, migrate your comments from another system,
integrate your registration platform, pair with your programmers, and help you
with bespoke installs. To learn more, [contact us](https://coralproject.net/pricing/).
