## Requirements

- MongoDB >=3.6
- Redis >=3.2
- NodeJS >=10
- NPM >=6.7

## Running

You can install Coral using Docker or via Source. We recommend Docker, as it
provides the easiest deployment solution going forward, as all the dependencies
are baked and shipped with the provided
[coralproject/talk:next](https://hub.docker.com/r/coralproject/talk) image.
When v5 releases to master, you'll be able to select it using
`coralproject/talk:5`.

### Docker

The easiest way to get started with Coral is through our published Docker image
and provided example `docker-compose.yml` file. The following assumes that you
have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine:

- Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/
- Install Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ (this is typically included in the Docker Desktop editions already)

```bash
# Create directories to persist the data in MongoDB and Redis.
mkdir -p data/{mongo,redis}

# Create the `docker-compose.yml` file to get started.
cat > docker-compose.yml <<EOF
version: "2"
services:
  talk:
    image: coralproject/talk:next
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - redis
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/coral
      - REDIS_URI=redis://redis:6379
      - SIGNING_SECRET=<replace me with something secret>
  mongo:
    image: mongo:3.6
    volumes:
      - ./data/mongo:/data/db
  redis:
    image: redis:3.2
    volumes:
      - ./data/redis:/data
EOF

# Start up Coral using Docker.
docker-compose up -d
```

Then head on over to http://localhost:3000 to install Coral!

### Source

Coral requires NodeJS >=10, we recommend using `nvm` to help manage node
versions: https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

```bash
# Clone and cd into the Coral directory.
git clone https://github.com/coralproject/talk.git
cd talk

# Install dependencies.
npm install

# Build the application dependencies.
# This might take a while.
npm run build
```

This should output all the compiled application code to `./dist`.

Running Coral with default settings assumes that you have:

- MongoDB >=3.6 running on `127.0.0.1:27017`
- Redis >=3.2 running on `127.0.0.1:6379`

If you don't already have these databases running, you can execute the following
assuming you have Docker installed on your local machine:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --restart always --name mongo mongo:3.6
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --restart always --name redis redis:3.2
```

Then start Coral with:

```bash
# Start the server in production mode.
npm run start
```

Then head on over to http://localhost:3000 to install Coral!

### Embed On Your Site

With Coral setup and running locally you can test embeding the comment stream with this sample embed script:

```
<div id="coral_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
    var talk = document.createElement('script'); talk.type = 'text/javascript'; talk.async = true;
    var url = '{{ CORAL_DOMAIN_NAME }}';
    talk.src = '//' + url + '/assets/js/embed.js';
    talk.onload = function() {
        Coral.createStreamEmbed({
            id: "coral_thread",
            autoRender: true,
            rootURL: '//' + url,
        });
    };
    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(talk);
})();
</script>
```

> **NOTE:** Replace the value of `{{ CORAL_DOMAIN_NAME }}` with the location of your running instance of Coral.

### Single Sign On

In order to allow seamless connection to an existing authentication system,
Coral utilizes the industry standard [JWT Token](https://jwt.io/) to connect. To
learn more about how to create a JWT token, see [this introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction/).

1. Visit: `https://{{ CORAL_DOMAIN_NAME }}/admin/configure/auth`
2. Scroll to the `Login with Single Sign On` section
3. Enable the Single Sign On Authentication Integration
4. Enable `Allow Registration`
5. Copy the string in the `Key` box
6. Click Save

> **NOTE:** Replace the value of `{{ CORAL_DOMAIN_NAME }}` with the location of your running instance of Coral.

You will then have to generate a JWT with the following claims:

- `jti` (_optional_) - A unique ID for this particular JWT token. We recommend
  using a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
  for this value. Without this parameter, the logout functionality inside the
  embed stream will not work and you will need to call logout on the embed
  itself.
- `exp` (_optional_) - When the given SSO token should expire. This is
  specified as a unix time stamp in seconds. Once the token has expired, a new
  token should be generated and passed into Coral. Without this parameter, the
  logout functionality inside the embed stream will not work and you will need
  to call logout on the embed itself.
- `iat` (_optional_) - When the given SSO token was issued. This is required to
  utilize the automatic user detail update system. If this time is newer than
  the time we received the last update, the contents of the token will be used
  to update the user.
- `user.id` (**required**) - the ID of the user from your authentication system.
  This is required to connect the user in your system to allow a seamless
  connection to Coral.
- `user.email` (**required**) - the email address of the user from your
  authentication system. This is required to facilitate notification email's
  about status changes on a user account such as bans or suspensions.
- `user.username` (**required**) - the username that should be used when being
  presented inside Coral to moderators and other users.
- `user.badges` (_optional_) - array of strings to be displayed as badges beside
  username inside Coral, visible to other users and moderators. For example, to indicate
  a user's subscription status.
- `user.role` (_optional_) - one of "COMMENTER", "STAFF", "MODERATOR", "ADMIN". Will create/update
  Coral user with this role.

An example of the claims for this token would be:

```json
{
  "jti": "151c19fc-ad15-4f80-a49c-09f137789fbb",
  "exp": 1572172094,
  "iat": 1562172094,
  "user": {
    "id": "628bdc61-6616-4add-bfec-dd79156715d4",
    "email": "bob@example.com",
    "username": "bob"
  }
}
```

With the claims provided, you can sign them with the `Key` obtained from the
Coral administration panel in the previous steps with a `HS256` algorithm. This
token can be provided in the above mentioned embed code by adding it to the
`createStreamEmbed` function:

```js
Coral.createStreamEmbed({
  // Don't forget to include the parameters from the
  // "Embed On Your Site" section.
  accessToken: "{{ SSO_TOKEN }}",
});
```

Or by calling the `login/logout` method on the embed object:

```js
var embed = Coral.createStreamEmbed({
  // Don't forget to include the parameters from the
  // "Embed On Your Site" section.
});

// Login the current embed with the generated SSO token.
embed.login("{{ SSO_TOKEN }}");

// Logout the user.
embed.logout();
```

#### SSO Login Prompts

In order to handle login prompts (e.g. a user clicks on the sign in button) you can listen to the `loginPrompt` event.

```js
var embed = Coral.createStreamEmbed({
  // Don't forget to include the parameters from the
  // "Embed On Your Site" section.
  events: function(events) {
    events.on("loginPrompt", function() {
      // Redirect user to a login page.
      location.href = "http://example.com/login";
    });
  },
});
```

### Development

Running Coral for development is very similar to installing Coral via Source as
described above.

Coral requires NodeJS >=10, we recommend using `nvm` to help manage node
versions: https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

```bash
# Clone and cd into the Coral directory.
git clone https://github.com/coralproject/talk.git
cd talk

# Install dependencies.
npm install
```

Running Coral with default settings assumes that you have:

- MongoDB >=3.6 running on `127.0.0.1:27017`
- Redis >=3.2 running on `127.0.0.1:6379`

If you don't already have these databases running, you can execute the following
assuming you have Docker installed on your local machine:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --restart always --name mongo mongo:3.6
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --restart always --name redis redis:3.2
```

We recommend installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) for better watch
performance.

```bash
# On macOS, you can run the following with Homebrew.
brew update
brew install watchman
```

Then start Coral with:

```bash
# Run the server in development mode in order to facilitate auto-restarting and
# rebuilding when file changes are detected. This might take a while to fully run.
npm run watch
```

When the client code has been built, navigate to http://localhost:8080/install
to start the installation wizard. **Note: Ensure `localhost:8080` is used in the permitted domains list.**

To see the comment stream goto http://localhost:8080/.

To run linting and tests use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the linters.
npm run lint

# Run our unit and integration tests.
npm run test
```

#### Email

To test out the email sending functionality, you can run [inbucket](https://www.inbucket.org/)
which provides a test SMTP server that can visualize emails in the browser:

```bash
docker run -d --name inbucket --restart always -p 2500:2500 -p 9000:9000 inbucket/inbucket
```

You can then configure the email server on Coral
by setting the email settings in
`Configure -> Email` in the admin:

| Field          | Value                |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| From Address   | `community@test.com` |
| Secure         | `No`                 |
| Host           | `localhost`          |
| Port           | `2500`               |
| Authentication | `No`                 |

Navigate to http://localhost:9000, click the "Monitor" tab. New emails received
on this screen.

#### Design Language System (UI Components)

We use [docz](https://docz.site) to document and develop our Design Language System. To start docz run:

```bash
# Make sure CSS types are generated.
# This is not required when `npm run watch` is already running.
npm run generate:css-types

# Run docz in development.
npm run docz -- dev
```

After compilation has finished you can access docz at http://localhost:3030/.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be set to configure the Coral Server. You
can expose them in your shell via `export NODE_ENV=development` or by placing
the variables in a `.env` file in the root of the project in a simple
`NODE_ENV=development` format delimited by newlines.

- `NODE_ENV` - Can be one of `production` or `development`. All production
  deployments should use `production`. Defaults to `production` when ran with
  `npm run start` and `development` when run with `npm run start:development`.
- `PORT` - The port to listen for HTTP and Websocket requests. (Default `3000`)
- `MONGODB_URI` - The MongoDB database URI to connect to.
  (Default `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/coral`)
- `REDIS_URI` - The Redis database URI to connect to.
  (Default `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`)
- `REDIS_OPTIONS` - A JSON string with optional configuration options to be used
  when connecting to Redis as specified in the [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/blob/1dac50a63753c2afc969315cfe38faf0edc50bc5/API.md#new_Redis_new) documentation.
  (Default: `{}`)
- `SIGNING_SECRET` - The shared secret to use to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with
  the selected signing algorithm. 🚨 **Don't forget to set this variable!** 🚨
  (Default: `keyboard cat`)
- `SIGNING_ALGORITHM` - The signing algorithm to use for signing JWT's.
  (Default `HS256`).
- `LOGGING_LEVEL` - The logging level that can be set to one of `fatal`,
  `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. (Default `info`)
- `STATIC_URI` - The URI that static assets can be accessed from. This URI can
  be to a proxy that uses this Coral server on `PORT` as the upstream. Disabled
  by default.
- `DISABLE_TENANT_CACHING` - When `true`, all tenants will be loaded from the
  database when needed rather than keeping a in-memory copy in sync via
  published events on Redis. (Default `false`)
- `DISABLE_MONGODB_AUTOINDEXING` - When `true`, Coral will not perform indexing
  operations when it starts up. This can be desired when you've already
  installed Coral on the target MongoDB, but want to improve start performance.
  **You should not use this parameter unless you know what you're doing! Upgrades
  may introduce additional indexes that the application relies on.**
  (Default `false`)
- `LOCALE` - Specify the default locale to use for all requests without a locale
  specified. (Default `en-US`)
- `ENABLE_GRAPHIQL` - When `true`, it will enable the `/graphiql` even in
  production, use with care. (Default `false`)
- `CONCURRENCY` - The number of worker nodes to spawn to handle web traffic,
  this should be tied to the number of CPU's available. (Default
  `os.cpus().length`)
- `DEV_PORT` - The port where the Webpack Development server is running on.
  (Default `8080`)
- `METRICS_USERNAME` - The username for _Basic Authentication_ at the `/metrics` and `/cluster_metrics`
  endpoint.
- `METRICS_PASSWORD` - The password for _Basic Authentication_ at the `/metrics` and `/cluster_metrics`
  endpoint.
- `CLUSTER_METRICS_PORT` - If `CONCURRENCY` is more than `1`, the metrics are provided at this port under `/cluster_metrics`. (Default `3001`)
- `DISABLE_LIVE_UPDATES` - When `true`, disables subscriptions for the comment
  stream for all stories across all tenants (Default `false`)
- `WEBSOCKET_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` - A duration in a parsable format (e.g. `30 seconds`
  , `1 minute`) that should be used to send keep alive messages through the
  websocket to keep the socket alive (Default `30 seconds`)
- `TRUST_PROXY` - When provided, it configures the "trust proxy" settings for Express (See https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html)
