## Contribute to the documentation
Clear docs are a prerequisite for a successful open source project. We value non-code and code contributions equally.

We are looking for _documentarians_ to:

* make clarity, grammar and completeness updates,
* create new / missing sections, and
* take the lead in making sections, or the over all structure better.

### But how?

* Our public docs site can be updated [here](https://github.com/coralproject/docs).
* [Let us know](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Contact-Us) if you'd like permission to update our wiki.
* Update any of our .md docs files by following [this guide](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Forking,-Branching-and-Merging).
* Our API docs need to be kept honest. [Update them here](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/docs/swagger.yaml).

## Integrate into your environment

First, [set up a dev environment](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Please let us know how this goes!

Talk is designed to integrate into existing environments in a variety of ways:

* [Auth integrations](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Security#authentication-strategies)
* [Push assets into Talk](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/routes/api/assets/index.js)
* Monitoring Hooks (coming in 2017)

If you're considering deploying Talk, [please let us know](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Contact-Us)! We are quite literally doing this for you and want to help you succeed any way we can.

If you are writing custom integration code in your fork of Talk, please consider keeping it generic and filing a Pull Request to contribute it back to the project! See our [forking and merging guidelines](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Forking,-Branching-and-Merging) for more info.

## Write some code

First, [set up a dev environment](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Please let us know how this goes!

### Build a New Feature / Plugin

Talk is beginning life as a Commenting Platform, but is architected to support many varieties of community engagement.

Please [contact us](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/wiki/Contact-Us) early and often if you'd like to help. We would love to hear your ideas for features and plugins and help you find a way to productively engage the project.

There is always more work to be done to make an application more stable, scaleable and secure.
