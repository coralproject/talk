# External Moderation Phases Guide

This document is in reference to external moderation phases emitted by Coral.
You can configure external moderation phases on your installation of Coral by
visiting `/admin/configure/moderation/phases`.

Once you've configured a external moderation phase in Coral, you will start to
receive moderation requests in the form of a
[External Moderation Requests](#external-moderation-request) at the provided
callback URL. These will be in the form of `POST` requests with a `JSON`
payload.

When a comment is created or edited, it will be processed by moderation phases in
a predefined order. Any external moderation phase is run last, and only if all
other moderation phases before it do not return a status. The current set of
moderation phases is listed in order [here](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/src/core/server/services/comments/pipeline/phases/index.ts).

Once you have received a moderation request, you must respond within the
provided timeout else the phase will be skipped and it will continue. It is
strongly recommended to [verify the request signature](#request-signing).

The external moderation phase must respond with one of the following:

1. Do not moderate the comment, and return a 204 without a body.
2. Perform a moderation action and return a 200 with a [External Moderation Response](#external-moderation-response)
   as a `JSON` encoded body containing the operations you want to perform on the
   comment.

## Request Signing

Requests sent by Coral for external moderation phases use the same process as
those used by webhooks. Refer to the [webhooks documentation](WEBHOOKS.md#webhook-signing)
for instructions on how to verify signatures sent by Coral.

## Schema

### External Moderation Request

```ts
interface ExternalModerationRequest {
  /**

   * an operation involving an edit operation on an existing Comment.
   */
  action: "NEW" | "EDIT";

  /**

   * created/edited.
   */
  comment: {
    /**
     * body refers to the actual body text of the Comment being created/edited.
     */
    body: string;

    /**
     * parentID is the identifier for the parent comment (if this Comment is a
     * reply, null otherwise).
     */
    parentID: string | null;
  };

  /**
   * author refers to the User that is creating/editing the Comment.
   */
  author: {
    /**
     * id is the identifier for this User.
     */
    id: string;

    /**
     * role refers to the role of this User.
     */
    role: "COMMENTER" | "STAFF" | "MODERATOR" | "ADMIN";
  };

  /**

   */
  story: {
    /**
     * id is the identifier for this Story.
     */
    id: string;

    /**
     * url is the URL for this Story.
     */
    url: string;
  };

  /**
   * site refers to the Site that the story being commented on belongs to.
   */
  site: {
    /**
     * id is the identifier for this Site.
     */
    id: string;
  };

  /**
