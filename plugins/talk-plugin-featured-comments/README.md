Enables the ability for Moderators to feature and un-feature comments via the
Stream and the Admin. Featured comments show in a first-place tab on the Stream
if there are any featured comments on that story.

When paired with the [talk-plugin-moderator-actions](/talk/plugin/talk-plugin-moderator-actions)
plugin, moderators will have the option of featuring comments from the comment
stream.
