# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We expect everyone contributing to The Coral Project to follow this code of conduct. That means the team, contractors we employ, contributors, as well as anyone posting to our public or internal-facing channels.
We created it not because we anticipate any unacceptable behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team, and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.

We commit to enforce and evolve this code over the duration of the project.

## Expected behavior

* Be supportive of each other.
* Be collaborative. Involve others in brainstorms, sketching sessions, code reviews, planning documents, and the like. It’s not only okay to ask for help or feedback often, it’s unacceptable not to do so.
* Be generous and kind in both giving and accepting critique. Critique is a natural and important part of our culture. Good critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive, focused on goals and requirements rather than personal preferences. You are expected to give and receive criticism with grace.
* Be humane. Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication, especially remote communication, where opportunities for misunderstanding are greater. Use sarcasm carefully. Tone is hard to decipher online; make judicious use of emoji to aid in communication.
* Be considerate.
* Be tolerant.
* Respect people’s boundaries.
* Do not make it personal.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Offer to help if you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of assistance (taking care not to be patronizing or disrespectful).
* If someone approaches you looking for help, be generous with your time; if you’re under a deadline, direct them to someone else who may be of assistance.
* Go out of your way to include people in jokes or memes, recognizing that we want to build an environment free of cliques.
* Show empathy towards other community members


## Unacceptable behavior

We are committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, socioeconomic backgrounds, nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs.
We expect that you will refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention.
Furthermore, any behavior or language which is unwelcoming—whether or not it rises to the level of harassment—is also strongly discouraged. Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of microaggressions—subtle put-downs which may be unconsciously delivered. Regardless of intent, microaggressions can have a significant negative impact on victims and have no place on our team.

Other inappropriate behavior:

*	Threats
*	Slurs
*	Pornography
*	Spam
*	Bullying
*	Copyright infringement
*	Impersonation of someone else
*	Violating someone’s privacy

If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you or someone else inappropriately, please alert the project lead at [andrewl@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:andrewl@mozillafoundation.org).


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

These guidelines are ambitious, and we’re not always going to succeed in meeting them. When something goes wrong—whether it’s a microaggression or an instance of harassment — there are a number of things you can do to address the situation. Depending on your comfort level and the severity of the situation, here are some suggestions:

* Address it directly. If you’re comfortable bringing up the incident with the person who instigated it, pull them aside to discuss how it affected you. Be sure to approach these conversations in a forgiving spirit: an angry or tense conversation will not do either of you any good. If you’re unsure how to go about that, try discussing with your manager or with the people and culture team first—they might have some advice about how to make this conversation happen.

If you’re too frustrated to have a direct conversation, there are a number of alternate routes you can take.

* Talk to a peer or mentor. Your colleagues are likely to have personal and professional experience on which to draw that could be of use to you. If you have someone you’re comfortable approaching, reach out and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to advise on how they would handle it, or direct you to someone who can. The flip side of this, of course, is that you should also be available when your colleagues reach out to you.

* Contact the project lead, Andrew Losowsky, [andrewl@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:andrewl@mozillafoundation.org), or the technical lead. We will work with you to help you figure out how to ensure that any conflict doesn’t interfere with your work, in confidence if you would prefer.

* Talk to Chris Lawrence. Chris oversees the project. He can be contacted at [clawrence@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:clawrence@mozillafoundation.org).

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should contact Chris with a concise description of your grievance.

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of what we do as The Coral Project, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone involved in the project and what we do.
