## How can I get help, submit a bug, or suggest a feature?

There are a few avenues to get in touch with us and others in the community for help.

To log a bug or request a feature, submit a Support ticket ([support@coralproject.net](mailto:support@coralproject.net)) and someone from our team will get back to you.

You can also request help on Github by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/issues). This also increases your chances of having someone from the community respond to help.

## How can our dev team contribute to Coral?

We are lucky to work with newsroom dev teams and individual contributors who span the world, and come from newsrooms of all sizes.

## What if we want to add a feature you don't have?

As well as basic word/phrase filtering and user recent history scores, Coral offers optional advanced features via third-party services:

- The [Toxic Comments filter](/administration/#toxic-comment-filter) integrates with the [Perspective API from Google](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) to detect the likelihood of toxicity of comments in real-time
- The [Akismet Spam filter](/administration/#spam-detection-filter) detects and blocks spam comments
