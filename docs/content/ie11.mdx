## Compatibility with IE11

We strive to make the Comment Stream Embed usable in IE11 without being pixel-perfect. If you develop on the Comment Stream you need to be aware of the following:

### CSS Variables

In order to support IE11 on the Comment Stream, every time new CSS is loaded, you need to call `polyfillCSSVarsForIE11()`.

```ts
import { polyfillCSSVarsForIE11 } from "coral-framework/helpers";

const loadProfileContainer = () =>
  import("./ProfileContainer" /* webpackChunkName: "profile" */).then((x) => {
    // New css is loaded, take care of polyfilling those css vars for IE11.
    polyfillCSSVarsForIE11();
    return x;
  });
```

### CSS Calc

Various bugs exists around `calc` support in IE11 (see
https://caniuse.com/#feat=calc). We work around most of them by pre-transforming
`calc` values using `postcss-calc-function`. Some css attributes might have an
issue if you use `css-variables` inside `calc`.
