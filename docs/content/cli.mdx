title: Configuration with CLI tools in Version 5
---

Coral’s CLI tooling has been reinvented in version 5. We’ve replaced the former `./bin/cli` tools with a completely new CLI application which is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/coralproject/coral-cli

The new CLI was built on `oclif` ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/oclif)), the open source CLI Framework originally built by Heroku, and offers an extensible platform for interacting with Coral via CLI.

## Installation

To get started with the new CLI run:

```
npm install -g @coralproject/coral-cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, run:

```bash
coral-cli [COMMAND]
```

Below is a list of commands available:

```

### `coral-cli plugins`

Not to be confused with "Talk Plugins" that were available in prior versions of Coral, `coral-cli plugins` are extensions to the `coral-cli` application. See code: [@oclif/plugin-plugins](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-plugins). Use this command to the list installed plugins.

_NOTE: Installation of a user-installed plugin will override a core plugin. e.g. If you have a core plugin that has a `hello` command, installing a user-installed plugin with a `hello` command will override the core plugin implementation._
