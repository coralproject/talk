title: Embedding Talk in Native Mobile Apps

When it comes mobile devices, the Talk client embed is already responsive and mobile friendly. We do not currently have plans to provide mobile SDKs, however, you can do this yourself.

One organization that has taken on the challenge of creating their own iOS native Talk client is [IGN](http://www.ign.com/). They were kind enough to share how they implemented Talk natively on their apps, which can be found [here](http://coralproject.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IGNNativeComments.pdf).

If you implement Talk on your mobile apps and would like to contribute your process for others, you can add those here in our docs via a PR or post an issue on Github and we can help you.
