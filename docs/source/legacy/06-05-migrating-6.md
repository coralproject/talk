Coral 6.0.0 introduces new features to assist with large communities using
Coral. To migrate from any 5.x.x release, ensure you first upgrade to 5.5.1
and allow all migrations to run. This means that you cannot upgrade from any
version below 5.5.1 to 6.0.0 directly.

### Supporting your Migration

We would love to help!

If you’re currently running any open source version 4.x/5.x and would like
assistance with planning and/or executing a migration please reach out to us at
support@coralproject.net.

We can help you figure out the best path forward, and give you early access to
the migration tools we’re working on.
