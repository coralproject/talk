You can add your own stylesheet in **Admin** > **Configure** > **Advanced** > **Custom CSS**.

If you would like to change the styling of any elements of the comment embed, we provide global classnames. Most elements will be tagged with either `.coral` or `.coral-stream`. 

The easiest way to find the classname for the element you're looking for is to use the web inspector, and then update your stylesheet accordingly.
