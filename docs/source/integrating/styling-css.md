You can add your own stylesheet in Admin > Configure > Tech Settings.

If you would like to change the styling of any elements in Talk, we provide global classnames with the prefix `talk-`. The easiest way to find the classname for the element you're looking for is to use the web inspector, and then update your stylesheet accordingly.

Plugins also have their own stylesheets located in the client directory.
