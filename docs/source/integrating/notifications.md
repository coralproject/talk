Talk currently supports 3 types of email notifications.


1. When someone replies to my comment
2. When a staff member replies to my comment
3. When my comment gets featured

Talk support 3 options for notification frequency: immediately, hourly or daily. Commenters can also opt-out of email notifications. Notifications are set to OFF by default.

Commenters cannot enable notifications until they have verified their email.

Note: Notifications are not currently supported for users that sign-up via Facebook or Google auth, or don't have an email attached to their account for any other reason.

### Configuring SMTP

You must setup SMTP to use notifications. The following ENV variables must be set:

```
TALK_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=email@email.com
TALK_SMTP_USERNAME=username
TALK_SMTP_PASSWORD=password
TALK_SMTP_HOST=smtp.domain.net
TALK_SMTP_PORT=2525
```

### Enabling Notifications

Enabling the `talk-plugin-notifications` creates a NotificationManager that creates and manages events send from the event emitter that is linked to the Graph API PubSub system.

Adding the `talk-plugin-notifications` plugin will also enable the `notifications` plugin hook. Any plugin that registers before the `talk-plugin-notifications` plugin will get picked up by.
