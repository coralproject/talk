## The Talk Admin

The Admin is your moderators will moderate your comments, and your Admins will
configure and manage the different parts of Talk.

### Moderate

This is the tab where Moderators will spend the majority of their time. They can
choose (via the dropdown) which story they would like to moderate, or moderate
site-wide.

#### Default Mod Queues

**New**

The New queue contains all comments that have not been moderated yet.

**Reported**

The Reported queue contains all comments that need moderator attention.

**Approved**

The Approved queue contains all approved comments.

**Rejected**

The Rejected queue contains all comments that have been rejected, either
manually by moderators or automatically, e.g. they have used a banned word.

**All**

The All queue contains all comments that have been submitted either article or
site-wide.

#### Moderation Badges

**Pre-mod**

The Pre-mod badge signifies comments that are being pre-modded.

**User**

The User badge signifies comments that have been reported by another user.

**History**

The History badge signifies comments that have been flagged because of a user’s
history.

**Toxic**

The Toxic badge signifies comments that are above the set Toxicity Probability
Threshold. Note you must have [talk-plugin-toxic-comments](./additional-plugins/#talk-plugin-toxic-comments) enabled.
[Read more about Toxic Comments here](./toxic-comments/).

**Suspect**

The Suspect badge signifies comments that contain a Suspect Word.

**Contains Link**

The Contains Link badge signifies a comment that contains a link, which can
sometimes mean it is a spam or ad comment.

**Flag Details View**

At the bottom of each comment in the moderation queues, you can see more
information about a comment’s flags by clicking on More Detail.

#### Moderator Actions

**Accept**

Accepting a comment ensures that the comment is displayed on the stream.

**Reject**

Rejecting a comment removes the comment from the stream.

**Feature**

Featuring a comment adds that comment to the Featured Comments tab on the
stream.

**Suspend User**

Suspending a user allows a moderator to give a commenter a “time-out”; during
that time they won’t be allowed to post comments or react to comments.

**Ban User**

Banning a user allows a moderator to permanently disallow a commenter to
interact with their community. The commenters previous comments will remain on
the site. This action can only be un-done manually by a moderator.

#### Viewing a User’s Comment History

In order to get an idea of what sort of a commenter someone is, moderators can
click on the commenters username in any moderation queue and see details about
their history.

**Username, Email and Member Since Date**

This shows the basic details about a commenter.

**Total Comments**

This shows the number of comments that a commenter has made that currently
display on the site.

**Reject Rate**

This shows the % of comments a commenter has had rejected by moderators, or
automatically.

**Reports**

This shows if a commenter is a reliable flagger, an unreliable flagger, or a
neutral flagger. [Read more about reliable and unreliable flaggers here](./trust/#reliable-and-unreliable-flaggers).

**Moderating from this View**

Talk also allows you to moderate a commenters recent comments from this view.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

Talk also supports a number of keyboard shortcuts that moderators can leverage
to moderate quickly:

| Shortcut | Action                     |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `j`      | Go to the next comment     |
| `k`      | Go to the previous comment |
| `ctrl+f` | Open search                |
| `t`      | Switch queues              |
| `z`      | Zen mode                   |
| `?`      | Open this menu             |
| `d`      | Approve                    |
| `f`      | Reject                     |

Note: "Zen mode" allows a moderator to view and action only one comment at a time. Enjoy the silence!

### Stories

In the Stories tab moderators can view all the stories that have Talk comments
embedded on them, as well as be able to Open or Close comment streams on
stories.

### Community

The Community tab houses everything having to do with your team and your
commenters.

#### Moderating Usernames

Any usernames that have been reported will show in the Reported Usernames
sub-tab. Moderators can approve usernames if they’re suitable, or reject a
username. If a username is rejected, the commenter will be notified that they
need to change their username; until they do, they will be suspended from Talk.
The updated username then again appears in this queue for a decision by
moderators.

#### Managing People & Roles

All your team and commenters show in the People sub-tab. From here, you can
manage your team members’ roles (Admins, Moderators, Staff), as well as search
for commenters and take action on them (e.g. Ban/Un-ban, Suspend, etc.). ###
Configure

See [Configuring Talk](./configuring-talk/).

## Moderating via the Comment Stream

Moderators can also choose to moderate comments in situ. If you are logged in as
a Moderator or Admin, you will see a caret dropdown on each comment that allows
you to Approve, Reject, or Feature comments, or Ban a User directly from the
comment stream.
