* Make sure you've adding the correct domains to your Permitted Domains in Configure > Tech Settings
* Make sure you've correctly added the embed via your CMS to your article pages
* Check the console for any errors and you can file a bug via [support](mailto:support@coralproject.net) if you can't resolve the issue

* Post 4.x Talk doesn't require 3rd party cookies to be enabled. Check the version of Talk you're using and you might consider upgrading.

If you're using your own custom auth plugin: 

* Review the code and your server logs to ensure your plugin is working correctly. Check [our auth docs](/talk/integrating/authentication/) for more tips.
* Ensure that your JWT token settings, especially expiry, is being set correctly. You can troubleshoot JWT related issues with the [JWT Debugger](https://jwt.io/).
* See if you can isolate if it's a particular group of users that are experiencing this issue, e.g. mods, admins, subscribers? Confirm they have the appropriate permissions to comment.
* Note if this is a new issue that happened after an upgrade - did you read the [migration docs](/talk/migration/3/) and the [release notes](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/releases)? This might help you resolve the issue
* Confirm that users who are affected have the correct `username.status`. If users have status `UNSET`, this is related to a bug with upgrading from 3.x to 4.x that has affected some organizations. Read more here about [upgrading from 3.x to 4.x](/talk/migration/3/).
