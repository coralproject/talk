You can add your own stylesheet in **Admin** > **Configure** > **Advanced** > **Custom CSS**.

If you would like to change the styling of any elements of the comment embed, we provide global classnames. Most elements will be tagged with either `.coral` or `.coral-stream`.

The easiest way to find the classname for the element you're looking for is to use the web inspector, and then update your stylesheet accordingly.

You can also navigate to https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/src/core/client/stream/classes.ts to see available stable class names.

### Custom body class for theming

You can set the class name of the `<body>` tag inside the embed by using the `bodyClassName` parameter when calling `Coral.createStreamEmbed`:

```js
Coral.createStreamEmbed({
  bodyClassName: "pink"
});
```

This will allow your styles to include variations:

```css
.pink button.coral {
  background: pink;
}
```

### Reaction styling

As of Coral 6.3.0, Coral has support for styling based on the number of
reactions that a given comment has received. It does so via the:

```sh
.coral-reacted-{{ n }}
```

Where `{{ n }}` is the number of reactions the comment has received. You can
invert this when creating CSS to allow you to highlight comments that have at
least `{{ n }}` reactions. For example, if you wanted to add a coral color to
comments with at least 3 reactions, you could write:

```css
.coral-comment .coral-indent {
  background-color: coral;
}

.coral-reacted-0 .coral-indent,
.coral-reacted-1 .coral-indent,
.coral-reacted-2 .coral-indent {
  background-color: transparent;
}
```
