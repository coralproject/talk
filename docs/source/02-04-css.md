You can add your own stylesheet in **Admin** > **Configure** > **Advanced** > **Custom CSS**.

If you would like to change the styling of any elements of the comment embed, we provide global classnames. Most elements will be tagged with either `.coral` or `.coral-stream`. 

The easiest way to find the classname for the element you're looking for is to use the web inspector, and then update your stylesheet accordingly.

You can also navigate to https://github.com/coralproject/talk/blob/master/src/core/client/stream/classes.ts to see available stable class names.

### Custom body class for theming

You can set the class name of the `<body>` tag inside the embed by using the `bodyClassName` parameter when calling `Coral.createStreamEmbed`:

```js
  Coral.createStreamEmbed({
    bodyClassName: "pink",
  });
```

This will allow your styles to include variations:

```css
  .pink button.coral {
    background: pink;
  }
```
