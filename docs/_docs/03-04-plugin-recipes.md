Plugin Recipes are plugin templates used to help bootstrap the development of a
plugin. Recipes are available at the
[coralproject/talk-recipes](https://github.com/coralproject/talk-recipes) repo.
When first developing a plugin with a recipe, you can simply visit the
aforementioned repository to find the desired recipe, and using the file
listings on the page, determine which files need to be modified to suit your
needs.

The following are the available recipes for use:
