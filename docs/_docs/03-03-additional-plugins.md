Source: [plugins/talk-plugin-slack-notifications](https://github.com/coralproject/talk/tree/master/plugins/talk-plugin-slack-notifications){:target="_blank"}

Enables all new comments that are written to be posted to a Slack channel as
well. Configure an
[Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks){:target="_blank"}
app and provide that url in the form of the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
detailed below.

*Warning: On high volume sites, this means every single comment will flow into
Slack, if this isn't what you want, be sure to use the provided plugin as a
recipe to further customize the behavior*.

Configuration:
{:.no_toc}

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (**required**) - The webhook url that will be
  used to post new comments to.

  the comment will be rejected. (Default `0.8`)

tag to the users that are subscribed to the service.
