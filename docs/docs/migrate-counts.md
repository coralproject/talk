title: Updating comment counts after data migration
---

After you migrate data from v4 to v6+, you will need to update comment counts in the new database, as comment counts are normally incremented in real time, so will need to be calculated from the imported data one time.

[Use the coral-counts tool to update comment counts](https://github.com/coralproject/coral-counts)
