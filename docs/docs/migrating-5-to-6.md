title: Migrating from v5.x to v7+
---

Coral 6.0.0 introduces new features to assist with large communities using
Coral. To migrate from any 5.x.x release, ensure you first upgrade to 5.5.1
and allow all migrations to run. This means that you cannot upgrade from any
version below 5.5.1 to 7.x directly.
