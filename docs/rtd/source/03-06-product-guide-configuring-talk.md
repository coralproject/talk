# Configuring Talk


## Configuring an Individual Stream

There are two ways Admins can configure Talk - the first is via the Configure
tab on the comment stream.

### Enable Pre-moderation

Allows toggling pre-moderation for the current comment stream.

### Pre-moderation Comments Containing Links

Allows toggling of pre-moderating comments that have links.

### Ask Readers a Question & Question Icons

Admins can choose to Ask Readers a Question in order to help guide the
discussion. [Read more about why this is important on our blog](https://coralproject.net/blog/the-empty-box/).

There are a selection of icons to display different messaging other than a
question on a particular stream, like an announcement, or general information
about the story.

### Closing a Stream

Closing a stream will prevent new comments. Previous comments will remain
displayed on the stream for readers to view.


## Global Configuration

Global configuration settings are available via Admin > Configure. These
settings are site-wide and will affect all of your comment streams.

### Stream Settings

#### Limit Comment Length

A maximum comment length across the site.

#### Comment Stream Description

Description text that will appear above every comment stream site-wide. We
recommend linking to your Code of Conduct or Community Guidelines. [Read tips on how to write a Code of Conduct here](https://guides.coralproject.net/create-a-code-of-conduct/).

#### Closed Stream Message

A message that will display when streams are closed.

#### Edit Comment Timeframe

The timeframe in seconds in which commenters have to edit their comment.

#### Close Comments After

Default time after which all comment streams will close.

### Moderation Settings

#### Require Email Verification

Require new users to verify their email address prior to commenting.

#### Enable Pre-moderation

Turn on pre-moderation across the site, meaning all comments will need to be
moderated before they will be displayed.

#### Pre-moderate Comments Containing Links

Turn on pre-moderation for comments with links across the site, meaning all
comments with links will need to be moderated before they will be displayed.

#### Banned Words List

A list of words that will trigger a comment to be automatically Rejected.

#### Suspect Words List

A list of words that will trigger a comment to be automatically Reported.
Comments with suspect words will display until a moderator takes action on them.

### Technical Settings

#### Permitted Domains

A list of domains where your Talk instance is allowed to be embedded. Typical
use is `localhost`, `staging.yourdomain.com`, `yourdomain.com`, etc.

#### Embed Script

This is the unique Talk script that is to be used to embed Talk on your website.

#### Custom CSS URL

The link to your custom stylesheet for Talk. This will override any default
styles, so you can make Talk your own!
