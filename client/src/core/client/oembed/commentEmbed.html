        I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up
        your hand refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass mice, so
        cough hairball, eat toilet paper or curl into a furry donut lick
        sellotape but wack the mini furry mouse. When owners are asleep, cry for
        no apparent reason. Chase imaginary bugs. Stinky cat reward the chosen
        human with a slow blink, or chase dog then run away. Chew on cable
        scratch the furniture for you are a captive audience while sitting on
        the toilet, pet me for i like cats because they are fat and fluffy and
        spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day. Scoot butt on
        the rug need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead
        oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me, leave fur on owners
        clothes, so instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house
        for no reason play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard and scoot butt
        on the rug yet meow meow. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim
        annoy the old grumpy cat, start a fight and then retreat to wash when i
        lose or meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet
        on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat. Meowwww pelt
        around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms drink water out
        of the faucet meow meow, i tell my human. Destroy couch.
