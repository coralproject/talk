# Kodiak's configuration file should be placed at `.kodiak.toml` (repository
# root) or `.github/.kodiak.toml`.

# version is the only required setting in a kodiak config.
# `1` is the only valid setting for this field.

[merge]
# Label to enable Kodiak to merge a PR.

# By default, Kodiak will only act on PRs that have this label. You can disable
# this requirement via `merge.require_automerge_label`.
automerge_label = "ðŸš€ merge it!" # default: "automerge"

# Kodiak will not merge a PR with any of these labels.
blocking_labels = ["don't merge"] # default: [], options: list of label names (e.g. ["wip"])

# Choose merge method for Kodiak to use.
#
# Kodiak will report a configuration error if the selected merge method is
# disabled for a repository.
#
# If you're using the "Require signed commits" GitHub Branch Protection setting
# to require commit signatures, _`"merge"` is the only compatible option_. Any
# other option will cause Kodiak to raise a configuration error.
method = "squash" # default: "merge", options: "merge", "squash", "rebase"

# Once a PR is merged, delete the branch. This option behaves like the GitHub
# repository setting "Automatically delete head branches", which automatically
# deletes head branches after pull requests are merged.

# Don't wait for in-progress status checks on a PR to finish before updating the
# branch.

[merge.message]
# Strip HTML comments (`<!-- some HTML comment -->`) from merge commit body.
# This setting is useful for stripping HTML comments created by PR templates.
# This option only applies when `merge.message.body_type = "markdown"`.
