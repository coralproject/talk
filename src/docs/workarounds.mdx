# Workarounds

A place to write down temporary workarounds.

## Babel

Babel versions are currently locked to 7.0.0-beta.49 because of this bug:

https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8167#issuecomment-397295483

## Relay Typescript

We are using a patched version of `Relay` that adds support for `Typescript`. Big thanks to [@alloy](https://github.com/alloy) for his fork on https://github.com/alloy/relay. Patched packages can be found in the top level `patches` folder.

This is no longer needed once https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/2293 has been merged and released.

## relay-compiler-language-typescript

We have patched [relay-compiler-language-typescript](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-compiler-language-typescript)  with an hack to fix an issue with `--noImplicitAny` support (https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-compiler-language-typescript/issues/48). Patched packages can be found in the top level `patches` folder.

## Relay Client Side Schema Extensions

We use Client Side Schema Extension in `Relay` to store client and UI related state. It works great, the only limitation currently is that locally created `Records` are garbage collected. We created a little helper in `talk-framework/lib/relay/createAndRetain.ts` that creates and retains these `Records` forever. Hopefully this gets resolved and we don't need to do this kind of manual lifecycle management.

```ts
import { commitLocalUpdate, Environment } from "relay-runtime";

import {
  createAndRetain,
  LOCAL_ID,
  LOCAL_TYPE,
} from "talk-framework/lib/relay";

commitLocalUpdate(environment, s => {
    const root = s.getRoot();
    // Create the Local Record which is the Root for the client states.
    const localRecord = createAndRetain(environment, s, LOCAL_ID, LOCAL_TYPE);
    root.setLinkedRecord(localRecord, "local");
});
```

## Type inference for `compose(...fn)`

[recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is a great library to work with Higher-Order-Components. `Typescript` is powerful enough to type a lot of HOC in a way that it works with type inference. However type inference currently does not work for `compose()` until this https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/24626 lands.

That's why in many cases instead of doing this

```ts
export type ContainerProps {
  …
}

const enhance = compose<InnerProps, ContainerProps>(
  withLocalStateContainer(…),
  withFragmentContainer(…)
);

export default enhance(Container);
```

We do this

```ts
const enhanced = withLocalStateContainer(
  …
)(
  withFragmentContainer(
    …
  )(Container)
);

export type ContainerProps = ReturnPropTypes<typeof enhanced>;
export default enhanced;
```
