# BaseButton

`BaseButton` strips away browser specific styling and unifies the look of the `button` and the `a` tag.
It detects a focus that came from the keyboard rather than mouse or touch and styles the button using
the `className` provided in the `classes.keyboardFocus` property.

When used as a `button` tag the default `type` is set to `button` instead of the standard `submit` in order
to avoid unintended form submissions.

## Basic usage
<Playground>
  <BaseButton>Push Me</BaseButton>
</Playground>

Instead of an `button` tag, we can render an `a` tag instead:

<Playground>
  <BaseButton anchor>Push Me</BaseButton>
</Playground>
