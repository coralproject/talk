auth is a directive that will enforce authorization rules on the schema
definition. It will restrict the viewer of the field based on roles or if the
`userIDField` is specified, it  will see if the current users ID equals the field
specified. This allows users that own a specific resource (like a comment, or a
flag) see their own content, but restrict it to everyone else. If the directive
is used without options, it simply requires a logged in user. `permit` can be
used to allow specific `USER_AUTH_CONDITIONS` that normally (if present) would
deny access to any edge associated with the `@auth` directive. If a User has
only some of the conditions listed, they will pass, but if they have at least
one more that isn't in the list, the request will be denied. If `unscoped` is
provided and is `true`, it will require that the user does not have any
moderation scopes applied to their account (such as a site moderator).
