"""
auth is a directive that will enforce authorization rules on the schema
definition. It will restrict the viewer of the field based on roles or if the
`userIDField` is specified, it will see if the current users ID equals the field
specified. This allows users that own a specific resource (like a comment, or a
flag) see their own content, but restrict it to everyone else. If the directive
is used without options, it simply requires a logged in user. If
`allowUnregistered` is provided and is true, then users that have not currently
completed their registration will be allowed, otherwise, unregistered users
cannot access.
